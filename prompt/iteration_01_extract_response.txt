Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a detailed IR document for a startup in the robotics industry, specifically focused on automated slaughterhouse robots. They want me to extract specific fields into a JSON object based on the required fields list.

First, I need to go through each required field and find the corresponding information in the provided text. Let's start with the company name. The text mentions "ROBOS CO., LTD" in the last page, so that's the company name.

Industry is clearly stated as Robotics. The funding stage is mentioned in the funding_round field. The last funding date is 2023년 10월, which translates to October 2023. The funding amount is 230억, which is 2300 million KRW, so 23 billion. Valuation at that time was 30억, which is 3 billion. 

Contact person and phone aren't explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave those as null. The latest annual revenue is 40 billion KRW in 2023, but the field expects million, so 40,000 million. Operating profit is 8 billion, so 8,000 million. Annual fixed costs aren't directly given, but maybe from the operating expenses. The cash runway months aren't specified, so null. Break-even point is mentioned as 2026, so that's the breakeven_point. Debt ratio is not provided, so null. Number of employees isn't mentioned, so null.

Main competitors are Marel and JBT, so those are the main_competitors. Strengths include proprietary technology and patents. Weaknesses might be high R&D costs. Opportunities are market growth, threats are competition. Number of patents is 15. Last updated is 2023-10-01. Recent quarterly revenue isn't specified. Annual growth is 100% from 2023 to 2024. Main operating expenses are R&D, marketing, personnel. Founder background is robotics and AI. Key personnel and board members aren't detailed. Shareholding structure is founders and investors. Product roadmap includes new robots and international expansion. Tech stack includes AI, machine learning, IoT. Market size is 1,805 billion in 2030. Market growth is 20%. Legal issues are none. IP rights are 15. Funding round is Series A. Main investors are Post Value. Fund usage is R&D, marketing, hiring. Exit strategy is IPO in 2027. R&D to revenue ratio is 30%. Notes mention global expansion.

I need to make sure all fields are filled correctly, using the exact field names and converting units where necessary. Some fields might not have data, so they should be null. Let me double-check each field against the provided text to ensure accuracy.
