Okay, let's see. The user provided a detailed IR document for a startup called ROBOS CO., LTD. They need me to extract specific fields from this document and return them in a JSON format. The required fields are contact_person, contact_phone, annual_fixed_cost_million, cash_runway_months, debt_ratio_percent, num_employees, recent_quarter_revenue_million, key_personnel, and board_members.

First, I need to go through the provided text and look for each of these fields. Let's start with contact_person. The document mentions "ROBOS CO., LTD" at the end, but there's no specific name given for the contact person. The same goes for contact_phone; there's no phone number listed. So these two fields might be missing or need to be inferred, but since the user says to return real values and not nulls, maybe I should leave them as empty strings or omit them. Wait, the user specified "Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the EXACT field names listed above as keys. Extract real values, not nulls." So if the information isn't present, perhaps I should set them to empty strings or zeros? But the example in the feedback shows some fields as empty strings. Let me check the example again.

Looking at the example in the feedback, the user provided a JSON with some fields as empty strings. For instance, contact_person and contact_phone are empty. So I should do the same here. The document doesn't mention any contact person or phone, so those fields will be empty.

Next, annual_fixed_cost_million. The document has a table with Total 매출액 and Total 영업이익 from 2023 to 2030. But fixed costs aren't directly mentioned. The closest might be operating expenses, but there's no specific figure given. So this field would be 0 or empty. Similarly, cash_runway_months isn't mentioned, so that's 0. Debt_ratio_percent also isn't provided, so 0. Num_employees isn't stated, so 0. Recent_quarter_revenue_million: the most recent quarterly revenue isn't specified, but the 2023 annual revenue is 40 million, but quarterly would be 40/4=10, but the document doesn't mention quarterly figures. So maybe 0.

Key_personnel and board_members: The document mentions "ROBOS CO., LTD" but no specific people. So these would be empty arrays.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all the required fields with either the extracted values or zeros/empty strings if not present. Let me verify each field again to make sure I didn't miss any data. The document does mention some financial projections, but none of the required fields are explicitly listed. So the final JSON will have zeros and empty strings for most fields.
